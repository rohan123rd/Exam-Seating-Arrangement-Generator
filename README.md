# Exam-Seating-Arrangement-Generator
This PHP code processes two uploaded excel files; one containing student master data(enrollment number, name, and class), and the other with seating arrangement data(enrollment number, subject code, and class). It combines the information to generate a new excel file with a seating arrangement report that lists students by class and subject.
The result is downloadable as an Excel file. It uses the PhpSpreadsheet library for reading, manipulating, and writing Excel files.
